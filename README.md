## 📖 What the project does

Queue Ease helps businesses manage appointments and live queues while giving customers a real-time view of their position and estimated wait time. It supports separate admin and customer flows, enabling service setup, working hours, and queue operations for admins, while customers can book or join queues via a shareable link or QR code.

**Key Features:**
- 🔐 Role-based authentication (Admin & Customer)
- 📅 Appointment booking with conflict prevention
- 📊 Live queue management and real-time updates
- ⏱️ Automatic no-show detection with time margins
- 📱 QR code and unique link generation for easy access
- 🔔 Push notifications for queue status
- 📈 Daily summary and analytics

For detailed product requirements, see [docs/PRD.md](docs/PRD.md).

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

Queue Ease follows **Clean Architecture** principles with feature-based modular organization:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│         Presentation Layer              │
│  (UI, Pages, Widgets, State Management) │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
                  ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          Domain Layer                   │
│     (Entities, Repositories Interface)  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
                  ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Data Layer                    │
│   (Models, Datasources, Repositories)   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
- **State Management:** flutter_bloc (Cubit pattern)
- **Dependency Injection:** GetIt + Injectable
- **Navigation:** GoRouter with authentication guards
- **Error Handling:** Sealed Result<T> type with structured exceptions
- **Logging:** Talker with environment-specific verbosity

For comprehensive architecture details, see [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK** 3.9.0 or higher
- **Dart SDK** 3.9.0 or higher
- **Android Studio** / **Xcode** for device builds
- **Firebase Account** (for backend services)
- **Git** for version control

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Clark605/queue_ease.git
   cd queue_ease
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Generate dependency injection code:**
   ```bash
   flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables:**
   
   Copy the example environment files:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.dev
   cp .env.example .env.prod
   ```
   
   Update `.env.dev` and `.env.prod` with your actual configuration.
   
   **Note:** `.env.dev` and `.env.prod` are git-ignored to protect sensitive data.

5. **Firebase setup:**
   
   Ensure Firebase is configured for your project:
   - Add `google-services.json` (Android) to `android/app/`
   - Add `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS) to `ios/Runner/`
   - Update `firebase_options.dart` if needed

### Running the App

**Development Build (with debugging tools):**

```bash
flutter run --flavor dev -t lib/main_dev.dart
```

Features enabled in dev:
- Device preview
- Verbose logging
- Debug overlays
- In-app log viewer at `/debug/logs`

**Production Build:**

```bash
flutter run --flavor prod -t lib/main_prod.dart
```

Production optimizations:
- Error-only logging
- No debug tools
- Performance optimizations

**VS Code Launch Configurations:**

Use the pre-configured launch options in `.vscode/launch.json`:
- **Dev** - Development flavor
- **Prod** - Production flavor

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Run all tests:
```bash
flutter test
```

### Run specific test file:

---

## 🚢 Deployment

### Firebase App Distribution with Fastlane

Queue Ease uses Fastlane to automate distribution of builds to Firebase App Distribution for testing.

**Manual Distribution:**

```bash
# Development build
cd android
fastlane android distribute_dev

# Production build
fastlane android distribute_prod
```

**CI/CD Automation:**

Builds are automatically distributed via GitHub Actions:
- **Dev builds:** Pushed to `develop` branch
- **Prod builds:** Pushed to `main` branch

**Required GitHub Secrets:**
- `FIREBASE_TOKEN` - Firebase CLI authentication token
- `FIREBASE_APP_ID_DEV` - Dev Firebase app ID
- `FIREBASE_APP_ID_PROD` - Prod Firebase app ID

**Troubleshooting:**
- **"Firebase token required" error**: Make sure `FIREBASE_TOKEN` environment variable is set
- **Firebase permission error**: Verify you have owner/editor permissions on the Firebase project
- **Tester group not found**: Create the "developers" group in Firebase Console > App Distribution > Testers

**Built with ❤️ using Flutter**
flutter run --flavor prod -t lib/main_prod.dart
```

**VS Code Launch Configurations:**

You can also use the pre-configured launch options in VS Code:
- **Dev** - Runs development flavor with device preview
- **Prod** - Runs production flavor

### Firebase App Distribution with Fastlane

QueueEase uses Fastlane to automate distribution of builds to Firebase App Distribution for testing.



**CI/CD Automation:**

Builds are automatically distributed via GitHub Actions:
- **Dev builds**: Automatically distributed when code is pushed to `develop` branch
- **Prod builds**: Automatically distributed when code is pushed to `main` branch

**Required GitHub Secrets:**
- `FIREBASE_TOKEN`: Firebase CLI authentication token
- `FIREBASE_APP_ID_DEV`: Firebase app ID for dev flavor
- `FIREBASE_APP_ID_PROD`: Firebase app ID for prod flavor

**Troubleshooting:**

- **"Firebase token required" error**: Make sure `FIREBASE_TOKEN` environment variable is set
- **Firebase permission error**: Verify you have owner/editor permissions on the Firebase project
- **Tester group not found**: Create the "developers" group in Firebase Console > App Distribution > Testers

### Environment Configuration

The app uses `.env` files for environment-specific configuration:

1. Copy `.env.example` to create your environment files:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.dev
   cp .env.example .env.prod
   ```

2. Update the values in `.env.dev` and `.env.prod` with your actual API keys and configuration.

**Note:** `.env.dev` and `.env.prod` are git-ignored to protect sensitive data. Never commit these files.

### Install and run

```bash
flutter pub get
```

If you use `injectable`, generate DI code:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

Run the app:

```bash
flutter run
```

Run tests:

```bash
flutter test
```

### Firebase setup (optional)

If you enable Firebase, add the platform configuration files and initialize Firebase in your app entry point. See the Firebase docs and follow the setup steps for Flutter.

### Usage example

- Admins sign in to configure services and manage today’s queue.
- Customers open a shared link or QR code to book a service and track their position.
