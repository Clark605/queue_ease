## 📚 Documentation Overview

### Core Documents

#### [Constitution (.specify/memory/constitution.md)](../.specify/memory/constitution.md)
**Project governance: Core principles and development standards**

- 6 Core Principles: Code Quality First, Flexibility & Extensibility, Testing Standards (NON-NEGOTIABLE), UX Consistency, Fast Delivery, Performance Requirements
- Technical Standards: Flutter/Dart requirements, Result<T> error handling pattern, AppException hierarchy
- Domain-Specific Rules: 5 core business entities, time margin policy for no-shows, MVP scope constraints
- Security & Compliance: Firestore security rules, RBAC enforcement, PII protection
- Development Workflow: Code review gates, quality checks, branching strategy (main/develop/feature)
- Amendment process and governance enforcement

**When to use**: Before starting ANY new work to verify compliance with project principles. Reference during code reviews to ensure architecture alignment. Consult when making major technical decisions.
